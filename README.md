## Overview
In this problem, I will analyze the data on the effect of a pesticide on aphid mortality [mort]. The file name for this dataset is “aphids.csv”. In this dataset, I tested the mortality rate of four different populations [pop] of aphids when they were exposed to different concentrations [conc] of a particular pesticide. I am interested to see whether any of these populations have developed resistance against this pesticide.

## Objectives
1. To conduct a thorough audit of the data to see whether it's messy and the level of messiness
2. Clean the data by handling duplicates, missing values and outliers
3. To fit a linear and generalized linear model to test the difference between the mean mortality of these aphid populations when they were exposed to different concentrations of the pesticide.
4. Fit another linear model and log transform the concentration of the pesticide in this model.
5. Fit a generalized linear model and suggest what distribution family I would choose for this model.
6.  State which model was the most appropriate model to test whether there are differences between the mean mortality of the aphid populations.
7.  Plot the scatter plot of response (Y-axis) vs predictor (X-axis), with groups (color and/or different symbols may help here). Add the fitted regression lines from your model and Ensure your graph is on the original scale and clearly labeled.
