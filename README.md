## Overview
This project entails the study of pollinators. The dataset contains information on two species of Sea Rocket Cakile maritima (Maritima) and Cakile edentula (Edentula), and their first-generation hybrid plants (F1 Hybrid). Cakile sp. is an invasive weed in Australia and I am interested in investigating the interactions between these species and their insect pollinators. Data was collected on the number of flower plants produced over time. I am interested in seeing whether there is a correlation between the number of flowers produced by each plant and the number of pollinators visited the plants in R.


## Objectives
To conduct a thorough audit on the data so as to see whether its messy and the level of messiness
